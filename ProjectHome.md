# What are OpenSim Tools ? #

The OpenSim Tools are PHP classes to be integrated in Opensim management web interfaces and other services.

We saw there is already many OpenSim web interface projects, so we decided to develop only a sort of API that can be integrated in any web interface.

# Our goals #

OpenSim is a wonderful Open Source project. Our goals are to make it closer to the web creating a powerful and simple to use API in PHP to interact easily with an OpenSim grid.

We hope this will be useful for all your OpenSim projects.
